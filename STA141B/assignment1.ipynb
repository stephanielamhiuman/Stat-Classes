    "## Part 1: The Doomsday Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The Doomsday algorithm, devised by mathematician J. H. Conway, computes the day of the week any given date fell on. The algorithm is designed to be simple enough to memorize and use for mental calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Example.__ With the algorithm, we can compute that July 4, 1776 (the day the United States declared independence from Great Britain) was a Thursday.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm is based on the fact that for any year, several dates always fall on the same day of the week, called the <em style=\"color:#F00\">doomsday</em> for the year. These dates include 4/4, 6/6, 8/8, 10/10, and 12/12.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Example.__ The doomsday for 2016 is Monday, so in 2016 the dates above all fell on Mondays. The doomsday for 2017 is Tuesday, so in 2017 the dates above will all fall on Tuesdays.\n",
    "\n",
    "The doomsday algorithm has three major steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Compute the anchor day for the target century.\n",
    "2. Compute the doomsday for the target year based on the anchor day.\n",
    "3. Determine the day of week for the target date by counting the number of days to the nearest doomsday.\n",

    "Each step is explained in detail below."

    "### The Anchor Day\n",
    "\n",
    "The doomsday for the first year in a century is called the <em style=\"color:#F00\">anchor day</em> for that century. The anchor day is needed to compute the doomsday for any other year in that century. The anchor day for a century $c$ can be computed with the formula:\n",
    "$$\n",

    "$$\n",
    "The result $a$ corresponds to a day of the week, starting with $0$ for Sunday and ending with $6$ for Saturday.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Note.__ The modulo operation $(x \\bmod y)$ finds the remainder after dividing $x$ by $y$. For instance, $12 \\bmod 3 = 0$ since the remainder after dividing $12$ by $3$ is $0$. Similarly, $11 \\bmod 7 = 4$, since the remainder after dividing $11$ by $7$ is $4$.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Example.__ Suppose the target year is 1954, so the century is $c = 19$. Plugging this into the formula gives\n",
    "$$a = \\bigl( 5 (19 \\bmod 4) + 2 \\bigr) \\bmod 7 = \\bigl( 5(3) + 2 \\bigr) \\bmod 7 = 3.$$\n",
    "In other words, the anchor day for 1900-1999 is Wednesday, which is also the doomsday for 1900.\n",

Document your function with a docstring and test your function for a few different years.  Do this in a new cell below this one."
